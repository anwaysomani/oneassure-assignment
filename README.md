This repo consists of both frontend and backend code bases. To get started, kindly perform the following actions:

# Backend:
- Change the default forlder of terminal to `cd logic/`
- Create a new virtual environment in terminal using the command `python3 -m venv venv`
- Switch to new environment `source venv/bin/activate`
- Once activated, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Once the command executes successfully, run `flask run`. This should render your Flask application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (no output on Browser)

# Frontend:
- Node version: 18.14
- Run `npm install`
- Once successfully executed, enter `npm run dev`
- Proceed to URL: `http://localhost:3000`

Performing the above two should start the project on 3000 port with functioning abilities.
Database is already connected to the application for ease of use.
